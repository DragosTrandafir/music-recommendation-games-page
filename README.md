# music-recommendation-games-site

This site has a main page, which aims at presenting general aspects of the singer Lana del Rey and how it made an impact for me. 

The secondary pages are accessible either from this mainpage, or one from the other, which is displayed before it in the mainpage.

Every page has a menu which gives access to the user to different parts of the page. All pages are devided into sections and have a terms and condition section an the end.

#MAIN PAGE
The first section in the main page only has an introductory image. The second section has text which is divided into paragraphs, and then, the page has a section where we canm access all the albums.

#BORN TO DIE
The first section of Born to die has an image with 2 css animations, so as for the page to be more aesthetic. Then the page has a presentation of the album and an interactive part, where all the album tracks are displayed and, if we hover over them, the background color will have a css animation. After that, we are recommended to go and listen to the album with another css text animation.

#ULTRAVIOLENCE
This section introduces Javascript interactivity and utility, through the first section, which not only presents the album, but also provides seeing the pictures at a bigger scale and bluring the background.
The second section permits the user to create a list of tracks from the album, having multiple commands.
We can select a track and add it to the list, delete it, or if we have more tracks in the list, we can do move-up operation or move-down operation, so a user can prioritize different songs depending on their preference.

#HONEYMOON
Honeymoon begins with a game, in which we can speen a wheel and get a random song, which then we can listen my directly clicking a link. 
The second section provides us more description and personal insight regarding the album.

#LUST FOR LIFE
This page has only one section, which is interactive. At first, the menu is not diplayed on the page, because we are provided with a square game which covers the entire screen. 
The game provides an input for the default number of squares and an animation moves the squares to the bottom of the container and then brings them back. When an animation is completed, a square is added and it begins again, and so on, until we click the stop button.
When we do this, the whole section is blured an another container is displayed over, which has different images and text presenting the album. In this container, the user is able to open the menu and either restart the animation with the same number or input squares, ore move on to the next page or go back to the main page. The animation also deliveres a warning if we input a string or a number of squares which is too big to handle.
